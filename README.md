# NaAssistant
NaAssistant is a chrome plugin that adds additional features to the browser game Naruto-Arena. It edits the local view of the user to add additional features as QOL improvements.

**UPDATE: the game naruto-arena.net is down, so this extension will no longer work**

- Mission images are clickable and redirect to the clicked mission (UPDATE: literally 3 days after releasing this plugin the devs fixed this problem internally themselves)
- Mission requirements are clickable and redirect to the clicked mission

- Mission pages show recommended teams to complete the missions

- The plugin popup now shows all your mission progress in bars

The plugin is reviewed and uploaded on the Google Webstore for easy install: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/naassistant/jmoneokkbkmcmnbenodlhfmblpjakmck

You can also just install this via github, download as ZIP file in the upper right corner, unpack, and load the folder in chrome chrome://extensions with developer mode turned on.

naruto-arena.net is not owned by me. This chrome plugin just edits the user's local view through html and js.

Have fun and Enjoy!
